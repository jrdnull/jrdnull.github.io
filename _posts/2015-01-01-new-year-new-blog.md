This year I am going to try actively blogging, and so I have a fresh
website powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) with a lovely theme based on
[@muanchiou](https://twitter.com/muanchiou)'s
[Scribble](https://github.com/muan/muan.github.com/releases).

I'm starting another course with The Open University next month
[(Developing Concurrent Distributed Systems)](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/modules/m362)
and I've recently moved onto a new project at work. So I should have plenty to
write about.
